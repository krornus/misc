scientific process

sigfigs
    nonzeroes are sig
    interior zeroes are sig
    trailing zeroes are significant
        right on nonzero after decimal
    trailing zeroes before decimal are sig
        100. - 3 sigfigs
        .100 - 3 sigfigs
    100 - 1 sigfig


    .000065 - 2 sigfigs
        leading zeroes not sig
    1.00065 - 6 sigfigs

discrete values have infinite sigfigs
    i.e. 1 mol

use smallest number
    multiplying
    dividing


sub/add
    same number of places as measurement with fewest number of decimal places

Joule(J)
calorie-energy heat 1g water 1C
Calorie-kc

2.80x10^2kWh to cal, Cal and J
1 cal = 4.184J
1 kwh = 3.60x10^6 J

1 cal = 4.184J
1 kwh = 3.60x10^6 J

1 cal = 4.184J
1 kwh = 3.60x10^6 J

2.80x1-^2 kwh x 3.60x10^6J/1 kwh = 1.01x10^9J

1.01x10^9 J x 1 cal/4.184J = 2.41 x 10^8 cal

%yeild = (1 actual yield - theoretical yeild)/theoretical yield*100

law summarized a relationship does not attempt to explain
theory attempts to explain a law

isotopes
    atoms of the same element w/ different masses
        diff neutrons

cation positive charge, loses electrons
anion negative charge, gains electron

u = g/mol

diatomic in nature
    two of same in nature
    TEST: H N O F Cl Br I

know metal or nonmetal
    TEST

law of constant composition
    relative amount of each element in a praticular compoud is always the same
        water always h2o

molecular mass: add atomic masses (and mul)

metal nonmetal
    name cation first
    add ide suffix to anion
    cation and anion balance each other

    k2o potassium oxide
    CdSe cadmium selenide


nonmetal nonmetal
    add prefix

intensive vs extensive properties
    intensive
        not depend on amount of present substance
            density
    extensive
        depend on amount of substance
            mass
need to know (TEST)
    polyatomic ions

2 AgNO3 + BaCl2-> 2 AgCl+ Ba(NO3)2

Ag: 107.87 g/mol
N: 14.01 g/mol
O: 15.9994
Ba: 137.327
Cl: 35.453


10.0g of AgNO3(MW 169.8569)
10.0/169.8569 = 0.0589 Mol

15.0g of BaCl2 (MW 208.233)
15.0/208.233 = 0.0720 Mol

We get 0.0589 Mol AgCl from AgNO3 <- Limiter
We get (0.02720)2 Mol from BaCl2


0.0589 Mol AgCl (MM = 143.32) = 8.44


homework 11 question 16 is wrong???

ionization energy

bottom->top lower -> higher ionization energy
left->right lower -> higher ionization energy

top right is highest

c = 2.998e8m/s
E = hu
lambda(u) = c
h = (plank) = 6.626e-34


n_l and n_h are the raw integer levels (1,2,3 etc)
1/wavelength = r*(1/n_l^2 - 1/n_h^2)
r = 1.097e7m^-1
